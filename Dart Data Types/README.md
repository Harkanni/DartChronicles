# Data Types in Dart
The different data types in dart are what most of us are already familiar with, they include 
 - Strings
 - Numbers
 - Booleans
 - Maps
 - Lists
## Number
Numbers in dart are used to represent numeric literals (i.e 1, 2, 3.5 etc.). Numbers in dart are divided into Integers and Doubles (or float if you are a JS developer).
### Integer
Integers in dart represents non-fractional numbers (whole numbers). Integers can be declared using the `int` keyword.
```
void main() {
    // integer declaration in dart
    int num1 = 20

    // another integer declaration in dart
    int num2 = 30
}
```
### Double
Double in dart represent fractional or floating point numbers. Doubles can be declared using the `double` keyword.
```
void main() {
    // integer declaration in dart
    double num1 = 20

    // another integer declaration in dart
    double num2 = 30
}
```

> It's important to note that you cannot assign an integer to a double and vice versa
