# DartChronicles
Welcome to DartChronicles where I'll be sharing my journey with Dart programming! Dart is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Google that I've been eager to learn.
## Sub-Repositories
### Basics

In this sub-repository, I cover the basic syntax and features of Dart programming language. I've included code snippets and examples to help beginners get started with Dart.
### Intermediate

In this sub-repository, I dive deeper into the more advanced features of Dart programming language, like classes, interfaces, generics, and lambdas. I've included code examples and explanations to help intermediate-level learners build on their knowledge.
### Libraries and Packages

In this sub-repository, I explore the built-in libraries in Dart, which have been useful for common tasks like I/O and networking. I also cover third-party packages and libraries using the pub.dev package manager.
## Projects

In this sub-repository, I showcase the projects that I've built while learning Dart programming language. These projects range from simple console applications to more complex web applications.
## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, simply clone it to your local machine and explore the sub-repositories. Each sub-repository includes its own README file that provides an overview of the topics covered and how to use the code examples provided.
## Contributions

I welcome contributions from the Dart community! If you find an error or have a suggestion for how to improve the code examples or explanations, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
## Conclusion

I'm excited to continue documenting my journey learning Dart programming language through this repository. I hope that it will be a helpful resource for others who are also learning Dart, and that it will inspire more people to explore this powerful and flexible programming language.
